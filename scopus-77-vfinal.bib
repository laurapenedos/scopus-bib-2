abstract={ChatGPT, an AI-based chatbot with automatic code generation abilities, has shown its promise in improving the quality of programming education by providing learners with opportunities to better understand the principles of programming. However, limited empirical studies have explored the impact of ChatGPT on learners’ programming processes. This study employed a quasi-experimental design to explore the possible impact of ChatGPT-facilitated programming mode on college students’ programming behaviors, performances, and perceptions. 82 college students were randomly divided into two classes. One class employed ChatGPT-facilitated programming (CFP) practice and the other class utilized self-directed programming (SDP) mode. Mixed methods were utilized to collect multidimensional data. Data analysis uncovered some intriguing results. Firstly, students in the CFP mode had more frequent behaviors of debugging and receiving error messages, as well as pasting console messages on the website and reading feedback. At the same time, students in the CFP mode had more frequent behaviors of copying and pasting codes from ChatGPT and debugging, as well as pasting codes to ChatGPT and reading feedback from ChatGPT. Secondly, CFP practice would improve college students’ programming performance, while the results indicated that there was no statistically significant difference between the students in CFP mode and the SDP mode. Thirdly, student interviews revealed three highly concerned themes from students' user experience about ChatGPT: the services offered by ChatGPT, the stages of ChatGPT usage, and experience with ChatGPT. Finally, college students’ perceptions toward ChatGPT significantly changed after CFP practice, including its perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and intention to use. Based on these findings, the study proposes implications for future instructional design and the development of AI-powered tools like ChatGPT. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract={Background: Dropout and poor academic performance are persistent problems in medical schools in emerging economies. Identifying at-risk students early and knowing the factors that contribute to their success would be useful for designing educational interventions. Educational Data Mining (EDM) methods can identify students at risk of poor academic progress and dropping out. The main goal of this study was to use machine learning models, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Naïve Bayes (NB), to identify first year medical students that succeed academically, using sociodemographic data and academic history. Methods: Data from seven cohorts (2011 to 2017) of admitted medical students to the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) Faculty of Medicine in Mexico City were analysed. Data from 7,976 students (2011 to 2017 cohorts) of the program were included. Information from admission diagnostic exam results, academic history, sociodemographic characteristics and family environment was used. The main dataset included 48 variables. The study followed the general knowledge discovery process: pre-processing, data analysis, and validation. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Naïve Bayes (NB) models were used for data mining analysis. Results: ANNs models had slightly better performance in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Both models had better sensitivity when classifying regular students and better specificity when classifying irregular students. Of the 25 variables with highest predictive value in the Naïve Bayes model, percentage of correct answers in the diagnostic exam was the best variable. Conclusions: Both ANN and Naïve Bayes methods can be useful for predicting medical students’ academic achievement in an undergraduate program, based on information of their prior knowledge and socio-demographic factors. Although ANN offered slightly superior results, Naïve Bayes made it possible to obtain an in-depth analysis of how the different variables influenced the model. The use of educational data mining techniques and machine learning classification techniques have potential in medical education. © 2024, The Author(s).},

abstract={Automated prediction of students' retention and graduation in education using advanced analytical methods such as artificial intelligence (AI), has recently attracted the attention of educators, both in theory and in practice. Whereas invaluable insights and theories for measuring and testing the topic have been proposed, most of the existing methods do not technically highlight the non-trivial factors behind the renowned challenges and attrition. To this effect, by making use of two categories of data collected in a higher education setting about students (i) retention (n = 52262) and (ii) graduation (n = 53639); this study proposes a machine learning model - RG-DMML (retention and graduation data mining and machine learning) and ensemble algorithm for prediction of students' retention and graduation status in education. This was done by training and testing key features that are technically deemed suitable for measuring the constructs (retention and graduation), such as (i) the Average grade of the previous high school, and (ii) the Entry/admission score. The proposed model (RG-DMML) is designed based on the cross industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) methodology, implemented using supervised machine learning technique such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and validated using the k-fold cross-validation method. The results show that the executed model and algorithm based on the Bagging method and 10-fold cross-validation are efficient and effective for predicting the student's retention and graduation status, with Precision (retention = 0.909, graduation = 0.822), Recall (retention = 1.000, graduation = 0.957), Accuracy (retention = 0.909, graduation = 0.817), F1-Score (retention = 0.952, graduation = 0.885) showing significant high accuracy levels or performance rate, and low Error-rate (retention = 0.090, graduation = 0.182), respectively. In addition, by considering the individual features selected through the Wrapper method in predicting the outputs, the proposed model proved more effective for predicting the students' retention status in comparison to the graduation data. The implications of the models' output and factors that impact the effective prediction or identification of at-risk students, e.g., for timely intervention, counselling, decision-making, and sustainable educational practice are empirically discussed in the study. © 2024},

abstract={During the COVID-19 pandemic, the challenges associated with the transition from face-to-face to emergency remote education increased concerns about student dropout. Aligned with this concern, this study investigates the impact of the pandemic on the dropout patterns of 3371 undergraduate students from a Brazilian institution. Using data mining and machine learning techniques, we developed predictive dropout models based on student data preceding and succeeding the onset of the pandemic. Through the interpretation and comparison of these models and with the support of statistical and graphical analyses, we identify that the patterns persistently indicate that young students in their initial semesters, characterized by lower income, academic performance, and interaction, remain most susceptible to dropping out. Despite the pandemic leading to an enhanced predictive capability of data regarding student interaction within the virtual learning environment, our analysis revealed a lack of significant variation in dropout patterns. Institutionally, this indicates that a considerable number of dropouts likely encountered challenges in adapting to higher education, both before and throughout the pandemic. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic The challenges posed by emergency remote learning, implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, may exacerbate the dropout problem and change the patterns involved in this phenomenon. Despite being widely used to identify dropout profiles and/or predict at-risk students, data mining and machine learning techniques have been little explored in the investigation of changes associated with the pandemic context. What this paper adds We employ data mining and machine learning techniques to construct predictive and interpretable dropout models for the pre- and during-pandemic contexts of a Brazilian institution. Comparing these models, we investigate the impacts of the pandemic on dropout patterns. The pandemic and the shift to emergency remote learning have an enhanced predictive capability of data regarding student interaction within the virtual learning environment. Throughout the pandemic, there was limited variation observed in dropout patterns, consistently highlighting young students in their initial semesters with lower income, academic performance and levels of interaction. Implications for practice and/or policy This study urges the inclusion of interactional student data in future dropout prediction research, capitalizing on the enhanced predictive power attained through the widespread adoption of virtual learning environments. Institutionally, the dropout patterns from before and during the pandemic suggest that students may be facing difficulties in adapting to higher education. In addition to the need to intensify preventive actions, this work indicates the need to conduct a study specifically targeting first-semester students to understand their needs better and redesign preventive policies. © 2023 British Educational Research Association.},

abstract={In the realm of Educational Data Mining (EDM), the predictive analysis of student performance has emerged as a pivotal area of interest, particularly within computer science education. This investigation employs machine learning and data mining techniques to project academic outcomes of computer science undergraduates, anchoring its framework on the Association for Computing Machinery's (ACM) 2013 Body of Knowledge (Bok), as delineated in the curriculum guidelines for undergraduate computing programs. Encompassing 18 Knowledge Areas (KAs), each with multiple Knowledge Units (KUs), the ACM2013 guideline serves as a comprehensive scaffold for curriculum development, ensuring an inclusive coverage of essential skills and subjects. Through an analysis of data from 2,756 students across nine years at Qassim University's College of Computer Science, this study aims to pinpoint performance levels across various KAs and semesters. Linear regression models were constructed to predict student performance, with their accuracy evaluated through Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The predictive accuracy varied across courses, with "Systems Programming" and "Graduation_1" demonstrating high alignment with actual scores, while courses like "Artificial Intelligence" and "Compiler Design" revealed significant discrepancies. A correlation analysis between predicted and actual scores further assessed the models' precision. Findings underscore the utility of EDM in academic settings, especially for tailoring predictive models that enhance student performance prediction in computer science. The identification of KAs with high predictive accuracy corroborates the curriculum's alignment with student achievements, whereas lower accuracy areas highlight potential gaps in curriculum or pedagogy, offering vital insights for educators and curriculum designers to refine educational strategies and resources for improved student outcomes.

abstract={In the era of artificial intelligence, this paper uses big data analysis to construct a data model of the knowledge system of law, with the help of clustering analysis, cluster students and resources to form a structured knowledge system of law. Combined with the natural language model, which accurately extracts important information, it provides personalized learning resources for students. Eventually, the teaching content is dynamically adjusted according to students' characteristics, resulting in the integrated design of a personalized teaching mode. The comparison found that the achievement improvement of students using the traditional teaching mode only ranged from 1.8% to 12.6%, and the achievement improvement interval was from 1.9 to 12.6 points. After applying the AI model-based instructional model, the relative improvement in student performance ranged from 19.2% to 19.8%, with an improvement interval of 14.2 to 15.7 points. The students showed a significant teaching effect by demonstrating a 25-point increase in their communication skills performance compared to the control class. © 2023 Wenli Liang et al., published by Sciendo.},

abstract={In recent years, there has been evidence of a growing interest on the part of universities to know in advance the academic performance of their students and allow them to establish timely strategies to avoid desertion and failure. One of the biggest challenges to predicting student performance is presented in the course 'Programming Fundamentals' of Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Information Systems Engineering careers in Peruvian universities for high student dropout rates. The objective of this research was to explore the efficiency of Long-Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM) in the field of Educational Data Mining (EDM) to predict the academic performance of students during the seventh, eighth, twelfth, and sixteenth weeks of the academic semester, which allowed us to identify students at risk of failing the course. This research compares several predictive models, such as Deep Neural Network (DNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Classifier (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). A major challenge machine learning algorithms face is a class imbalance in a dataset, resulting in over-fitting to the available data and, consequently, low accuracy. We use Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the data needed in our proposal. From the experimental results based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score, the superiority of our model is verified concerning a better classification, with 98.3% accuracy in week 8 using LSTM-GAN, followed by DNN-GAN with 98.1% accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Complex assessment processes and limited improvement opportunities contribute to the challenges currently confronting higher education institutions. Recent focus shifts in academic research have sought to leverage the unique datasets generated within these institutions, aiming to refine student identification and performance metrics. This study primarily investigates the role data analysis and mining play in augmenting the assessment capabilities within these education institutions. The uncertainties surrounding student progression and retention rates necessitate the systematic evaluation of extensive data amassed within institutional databases and Learning Supervision Method (LSM) datasets. The intent is to provide academic professionals with detailed analytics on student activities and progression, enabling the tailoring of support to individual students and thus potentially increasing the efficiency of their coursework completion. In response to the growing urgency to evaluate and improve graduation outcomes without compromising educational quality, this study employs classification and data mining techniques to analyze graduate student academic performance. Educational institutions, striving to optimize limited resources, stand to benefit from the recognized decision-making power of deep learning models. A comparative analysis of the performance of elementary school students in college settings versus college students revealed a superior performance by the elementary school cohort. The proposed Graduate Interlinked Precedent Academic-based Performance Analysis using Enhanced Correlated Feature Set Model (GIPA-PA-ECFSM) illuminated a significant correlation between third-year and final-year performances. The proposed model aids in the identification of student performance across semesters, facilitating more effective student monitoring.

abstract={The employment of college students is an important issue that affects national development and social stability. In recent years, the increase in the number of graduates, the pressure of employment, and the epidemic have made the phenomenon of 'slow employment' increasingly prominent, becoming an urgent problem to be solved. Data mining and machine learning methods are used to analyze and predict the employment prospects for graduates and provide effective employment guidance and services for universities, governments, and graduates. It is a feasible solution to alleviate the problem of 'slow employment' of graduates. Therefore, this study proposed a feature selection prediction model (bGEBA-SVM) based on an improved bat algorithm and support vector machine by extracting 1694 college graduates from 2022 classes in Zhejiang Province. To improve the search efficiency and accuracy of the optimal feature subset, this paper proposed an enhanced bat algorithm based on the Gaussian distribution-based and elimination strategies for optimizing the feature set. The training data were input to the support vector machine for prediction. The proposed method is experimented by comparing it with peers, well-known machine learning models on the IEEE CEC2017 benchmark functions, public datasets, and graduate employment prediction dataset. The experimental results show that bGEBA-SVM can obtain higher prediction Accuracy, which can reach 93.86%. In addition, further education, student leader experience, family situation, career planning, and employment structure are more relevant characteristics that affect employment outcomes. In summary, bGEBA-SVM can be regarded as an employment prediction model with strong performance and high interpretability. © 2023 Wei et al.

Sixty students from the Faculty of Education at the University of Alicante participated in 16 educational activities recording close-ups of their faces and completing the AEQ emotional self-report, as well as detailed reports from the subsequent review of their videos. In addition, they completed the VCQ-36 test to measure their volitional competencies and relate their influence on their emotional response. The results indicate a high coherence between the emotional expressions detected by the automatic system and the detailed emotional self-reports, but insufficient precision to meet the CVT requirements. On the other hand, both the AEQ test results and the emotion expression recognition software suggest students' preference for participative activities as opposed to passive ones. Meanwhile, statistical analysis results indicate that volitional competencies seem to influence the emotional response of students in the educational context, although the AI system does not show sufficient sensitivity in this field. Implications and limitations of this study for future work are discussed. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Student motivation and involvement in the learning process are highly related to appropriate emotional regulation, which can be associated with particular educational activities, strategies and methodologies. Deep learning technology based on convolutional neural networks feeds automatic systems focused on facial expression recognition from image analysis. What this paper adds There is high coherence between the emotional expressions detected by the AI system and the students' emotional self-reports, but the AI system provides just emotional valences, insufficient to meet the CVT framework. Both emotional self-reports and the emotion recognition software suggest students' preference for active educational activities as opposed to passive ones. Volitional competencies seem to influence the emotional response of students in the educational context. Implications for practice and/or policy It is possible to use automatic systems to effectively monitor the emotional response of students in the learning process. Only if sensitivity improved, a real-time, easy-to-interpret emotional expression recognition software interface could be implemented to assist teachers with the emotional management of their classes within the CVT framework, maximizing their motivation and engagement. © 2023 The Authors.

abstract={Increasing productivity in educational systems is of great imprtance. Researchers are keen to predict the academic performance of students; this is done to enhance the overall productivity of educational system by effectively identifying students whose performance is below average. This universal concern has been combined with data science leading to the creation of an interdisciplinary research area called Educational Data Mining. One of the recent issues which has been addressed by researchers is training generalizable models from different aspects such as gender, major, geography and etc. Therefore, in this research we use machine learning methods to predict student's performance, emphasizing on training generalizable models from geographical aspect. For this purpose, a questionnaire containing 37 questions was designed, through which 536 answers were collected, including 111 international and 425 domestic answers. According to the literature, student performance is mostly determined based on the GPA (grade point average) of the entire course. In this research, information about the GPA of respondents in undergraduate and graduate courses was collected in the form of three classes. After a final review of the models employed in previous studies, the main models selected and used for classification purposes included SVM, CNN, Adaboost, RF, SVM, and DT. Feature selection is performed using XGBoost, random forest, as well as SVML1. The main issue investigated in this study is the generalizability of the models trained on domestic (iranian) data and tested on international data (non-iranian). Experimental results show that the best models trained with specific dataset collected in this research had generalizability comparing to base models’ outcomes which were trained and tested on domestic data. Meanwhile, Random forest and CNN models shows the best performance with the average of accuracy and F-score of 73.5 and 68.5, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The utilization of data mining techniques for the prompt prediction of academic success has gained significant importance in the current era. There is an increasing interest in utilizing these methodologies to forecast the academic performance of students, thereby facilitating educators to intervene and furnish suitable assistance when required. The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal methods for feature engineering and selection in the context of regression and classification tasks. This study compared the Boruta algorithm and Lasso regression for regression, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Random Forest Importance (RFI) for classification. According to the findings, Gradient Boost for the regression part of this study had the least Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) of 12.93 and 18.28, respectively, in the case of the Boruta selection method. In contrast, RFI was found to be the superior classification method, yielding an accuracy rate of 78% in the classification part. This research emphasized the significance of employing appropriate feature engineering and selection methodologies to enhance the efficacy of machine learning algorithms. Using a diverse set of machine learning techniques, this study analyzed the OULA dataset, focusing on both feature engineering and selection. Our approach was to systematically compare the performance of different models, leading to insights about the most effective strategies for predicting student success. © 2023 by the author.},

abstract={The ability to accurately predict how students will perform has a significant impact on the teaching and learning process, as it can inform the instructor to devote extra attention to a particular student or group of students, which in turn prevents those students from failing a certain course. When it comes to educational data mining, the accuracy and explainability of predictions are of equal importance. Accuracy refers to the degree to which the predicted value was accurate, and explainability refers to the degree to which the predicted value could be understood. This study used machine learning to predict the features that best contribute to the performance of a student, using a dataset collected from a public university in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Experimental analysis was carried out with Black-Box (BB) and White-Box (WB) machine-learning classification models. In BB classification models, a decision (or class) is often predicted with limited explainability on why this decision was made, while in WB classification models decisions made are fully interpretable to the stakeholders. The results showed that these BB models performed similarly in terms of accuracy and recall whether the classifiers attempted to predict an A or an F grade. When comparing the classifiers' accuracy in making predictions on B grade, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) was found to be superior to Naïve Bayes (NB). However, the recall results were quite similar except for the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier. When predicting grades C and D, RF had the best accuracy and NB the worst. RF had the best recall when predicting a C grade, while NB had the lowest. When predicting a D grade, SVM had the best recall performance, while NB had the lowest. © by the authors.},

abstract={Generic competence (GC) development is an integral part of higher education to provide holistic education and enhance student career development. It also plays a critical role in complementing the curriculum. Many tertiary institutions provide various GC development activities (GCDA). Moreover, institutions strongly need to further understand student participation, especially its relationship to student backgrounds, activity profiles, and academic results. With the fast advancement of educational technologies and data mining, data analytics (DA) in formal learning and online education has been widely explored. However, there has been little work on student behavior in GCDA. To fill this gap and to provide new contributions, we conduct a comprehensive study to investigate the interrelationship of GCDA participation and academic performance before and after higher education with significant and representative data (over 10 000 records) across three years. Hypotheses are formulated and validated, and the findings are triangulated with machine learning (ML) and DA. With supervised learning, the predictors of academic performance and GCDA participation are formulated, and the features to enhance predictions are analyzed. We develop predictors using novel approaches of genetic algorithms and Stacking in ML. The impacts of the breadth and depth of involvement are also studied. Results indicate that involvement in GCDA positively impacts student academic results. Our novel approaches give improvements in predicting student participation. Our holistic studies covering hypothesis validation, data analysis, and ML provide valuable insights into GCDA development. © 2008-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={With the rapid advances in Information Technology (IT), the focus on engaging computing students to gain practical experience in the IT industry before graduation is becoming increasingly complex without incorporating pedagogical strategies of success in curricula. The goal is to enable computing major students to gain in-depth knowledge and practical understanding of the IT working environment before graduating through essential industry-driven practical skills based on international standards and best practices. Unfortunately, tracking and analyzing students’ practical skills performance during their IT field training programs, which are conducted primarily off-campus at various public and private organizations, before, during, and after the training period, is a daunting task for both the college instructors and the industry trainers. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a Sustainable University Field Training (SUNFIT) framework, which is a pedagogical approach towards mining the educational data using machine learning to integrate and measure the field training programs against the internationally recognized accreditation standards such as Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). The study employs machine learning models aimed at continuously measuring and monitoring international ABET accreditation requirements on computing major courses’ academic data, elucidating student performance across various semesters, integrating best practices, and producing an evidence-based rationale approach for evaluating weak learning outcomes (LOs) with minimal manual intervention, as well as preventing faculty-specific portfolio errors. The proposed approach could be easily developed by academics, researchers, or even students, and for a variety of purposes, including enhancing poor student outcomes (SOs). In addition, various data mining and machine learning approaches have been investigated over field training assessment data for successful prediction in subsequent cycles. The results are promising, with Naïve Bayes obtaining the highest accuracy of 90.54% followed by J48 and PART algorithms at 87.83%. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Modern technology integration in higher education on the example of artificial intelligence use as a personalized learning platform can facilitate learning of various subjects. The research questions are explained by the desire to obtain new experimental data on the modern technology integration in higher education using artificial intelligence as an example, and based on the data obtained, to optimize and improve teaching approaches. The research aims to study the impact of artificial intelligence technologies in higher educational institutions of the People’s Republic of China on improving education system. The study relies on experimental design to determine the effectiveness of implementing the Raptivity personalized learning platform by integrating statistical data analysis and paired t-test. The study involved 356 students. The students demonstrated poor or average performance in the pre-assessment of all five subjects before the introduction of artificial intelligence technologies and average or high knowledge in the post-assessment. Students’ post-assessment performance in mathematics increased by 22.9%, computer science – by 18.4%, management – by 13.4%, English – by 14.7%, sociology – by 13.7%. According to the t-values that were calculated during the study, there is a significant difference in student performance in the five subjects before and after the Raptivity personalized learning platform introduction. Thus, the intervention in the form of artificial intelligence integration has demonstrated its effectiveness in the context of improving student performance in five humanities and exact subjects. This contributed to an increase in the learning process effectiveness. This research is of practical significance as it demonstrates the positive impact of the Raptivity personalized learning platform on students’ performance. The results obtained confirm the need for the modern technology integration on the example of the artificial intelligence introduction in the education system of the People’s Republic of China and other countries. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Institutions of higher learning have made persistent efforts to provide students with a high-quality education. Educational data mining (EDM) enables academic institutions to gain insight into student data in order to extract information for making predictions. COVID-19 represents the most catastrophic pandemic in human history. As a result of the global pandemic, all educational systems were shifted to online learning (OL). Due to issues with accessing the internet, disinterest, and a lack of available tools, online education has proven challenging for many students. Acquiring accurate education has emerged as a major goal for the future of this popular medium of education. Therefore, the focus of this research was to identifying attributes that could help in students’ performance prediction through a generalizable model achieving precision education in online education. The dataset used in this research was compiled from a survey taken primarily during the academic year of COVID-19, which was taken from the perspective of Pakistani university students. Five machine learning (ML) regressors were used in order to train the model, and its results were then analyzed. Comparatively, SVM has outperformed the other methods, yielding 87.5% accuracy, which was the highest of all the models tested. After that, an efficient hybrid ensemble model of machine learning was used to predict student performance using NB, KNN, SVM, decision tree, and logical regression during the COVID-19 period, yielding outclass results. Finally, the accuracy obtained through the hybrid ensemble model was obtained as 98.6%, which demonstrated that the hybrid ensemble learning model has performed better than any other model for predicting the performance of students. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={The successful instructional design of self and peer assessment in higher education poses several challenges that instructors need to be aware of. One of these is the influence of students’ personalities on their intention to adopt peer assessment. This paper presents a quasi-experiment in which 85 participants, enrolled in the first-year of a Computer Engineering programme, were assessed regarding their personality and their acceptance of three modalities of peer assessment (individual, pairs, in threes). Following a within-subjects design, the students applied the three modalities, in a different order, with three different activities. An analysis of the resulting 1195 observations using ML techniques shows how the Random Forest algorithm yields significantly better predictions for three out of the four adoption variables included in the study. Additionally, the application of a set of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques shows that Agreeableness is the best predictor of Usefulness and Ease of Use, while Extraversion is the best predictor of Compatibility, and Neuroticism has the greatest impact on global Intention to Use. The discussion highlights how, as it happens with other innovations in educational processes, low levels of Consciousness is the most consistent predictor of resistance to the introduction of peer assessment processes in the classroom. Also, it stresses the value of peer assessment to augment the positive feelings of students scoring high on Neuroticism, which could lead to better performance. Finally, the low impact of the peer assessment modality on student perceptions compared to personality variables is debated. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Formative assessments are vital for supporting learning and performance but are also considered to increase the workload of teachers. As self-assessments in higher education are increasingly facilitated via digital learning environments allowing to offer direct feedback and tracking students' digital learning behaviour these constraints might be reduced. Yet, learning analytics do not make sufficient use of data on assessments. Aims: This exploratory case study uses learning analytics methods for investigating students' engagement with self-assessments and how this relates to performance in the final exam and self-reported self-testing strategies. Materials &amp; Methods: The research study has been conducted at a European university in a twelve-weeks course of a Bachelor's program in Economic and Business Education including nenroll = 159 participants. During the semester, students were offered nine self-assessments each including three to eight tasks plus one mid-term and one exam-preparation self-assessment including all prior self-assessments tasks. The self-assessment interaction data for each student included: the results of the last self-assessment attempt, the number of processed self-assessment tasks, and the time spent on the last self-assessment attempt, the total self-assessment attempts, and the first as well as last access of each self-assessment. Data analytics included unsupervised machine learning and process mining approaches. Results: Findings indicate that students use the self-assessments predominantly before summative assessments. Two distinct clusters based on engagement with self-assessments could be identified and engagement was positively related to performance in the final exam. The findings from learning analytics data were also indicated by students' self-reported use of self-testing strategies. Discussion: With the help of multiple data from self-reports, formal exams, and a learning analytics system, the findings provided multiple perspectives on the use of self-assessments and their relationships with course performance. These findings call for applying assessment analytics and related frameworks in learning analytics as well as providing learners with related adaptive feedback. Conclusion: Future research might investigate different (self-report) variables for clustering, other student cohorts or self-assessment forms. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Context: In the education sector, variables have been identified which considerably affect students’ academic performance. In the last decade, research has been carried out from various fields such as psychology, statistics, and data analytics in order to predict academic performance. Method: Data analytics, especially through Machine Learning tools, allows predicting academic performance using supervised learning algorithms based on academic, demographic, and sociodemographic variables. In this work, the most influential variables in the course of students’ academic life are selected through wrapping, embedded, filter, and assembly methods, as well as the most important characteristics semester by semester using Machine Learning algorithms (Decision Trees, KNN, SVC, Naive Bayes, LDA), which were implemented using the Python language. Results: The results of the study show that the KNN is the model that best predicts academic performance for each of the semesters, followed by Decision Trees, with precision values that oscillate around 80 and 78,5 % in some semesters. Conclusions: Regarding the variables, it cannot be said that a student’s per-semester academic average necessarily influences the prediction of academic performance for the next semester. The analysis of these results indicates that the prediction of academic performance using Machine Learning tools is a promising approach that can help improve students’ academic life allow institutions and teachers to take actions that contribute to the teaching-learning process. © The authors.},

abstract={Predicting academic success is essential in higher education because it is perceived as a critical driver for scientific and technological advancement and countries’ economic and social development. This paper aims to retrieve the most relevant attributes for academic success by applying educational data mining (EDM) techniques to a Portuguese business school bachelor’s historical data. We propose two predictive models to classify each student regarding academic success at enrolment and the end of the first academic year. We implemented a SEMMA methodology and tried several machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, KNN, neural networks, and SVM. The best classifier for academic success at the entry-level reached is a random forest with an accuracy of 69%. At the end of the first academic year, an MLP artificial neural network’s best performance was achieved with an accuracy of 85%. The main findings show that at enrolment or the end of the first year, the grades and, thus, the student’s previous education and engagement with the school environment are decisive in achieving academic success. © 2023 by the authors.

abstract={The effect of physical activity (PA) on academic achievement has long been a hot research issue in physical education, but few studies have been conducted using machine learning methods for analyzing activity behavior. In this paper, we collected the data on both physical activity and academic performance from 2,219 undergraduate students (Mean = 19 years) over a continuous period of 12 weeks within one academic semester. Based on students’ behavioral indicators transformed from a running APP interface and the average academic course scores, two models were constructed and processed by CHAID decision tree for regression analysis and significance detection. It was found that first, to attain higher academic performance, it is imperative for students to not only exhibit exceptional activity regularity, but also sustain a reduced average step frequency; second, the students completing running exercise with an average frequency of 1 time/week and the duration of 16–25 min excelled over approximately 88 percentage of other students on academic performance; third, the processing validity and reliability of physical observation data in complex systems can be improved by utilizing decision tree as a leveraging machine learning tool and statistical method. These findings provide insights for educational practitioners and policymakers who will seek to enhance college students’ academic performance through physical education programs, combined with data mining methods.

abstract={The use of social annotation tools in higher education has attracted the attention of researchers with many studies having looked at student perceptions and attitudes to them. This paper investigates students’ activity and perceptions of the social annotation tool Diigo along with the extent to which they correlate with their approaches to learning. Quantitative analysis was conducted with year 1 Administration students as part of cross-curricular cooperation between the courses Basic Informatics and English for Specific Purposes. The revised two-factor study process questionnaire and a questionnaire about students’ attitudes to collaboration in Diigo were used, together with qualitative analysis of a learning achievement post-test. Spearman’s correlation coefficients, the Kruskal-Wallis H test and Dunn’s Test were used for statistical analysis. The empirical results reveal a positive attitude to collaboration in Diigo, and a connection between a deep learning approach and quantity of activity as well as a connection between a deep learning approach and positive perceptions of the experience. The results suggest that collaborative tasks in Diigo can be useful in cross-curricular cooperation, and that considering students’ different study approaches while forming groups can improve student activity and motivation. © 2023 The Author(s).

abstract={Predicting student performance is a crucial research area in educational data mining. Student grades are influenced by various factors such as past academic performance, family background, and personal achievements. However, it is difficult to collect many relevant factors other than past academic performance, and it is not ideal to predict student performance using past academic records alone. Therefore, reducing the difficulty of data collection while maintaining timeliness and prediction accuracy remains a pressing issue. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel model for predicting university student performance based on multi-feature fusion and attention mechanisms. The proposed model focuses on analyzing historical academic grades from multiple dimensions among university students to extract features that reveal relationships between courses and students, among different students themselves, or even between courses themselves. Additionally, an attention mechanism is introduced to explore the relationship between different dimensional features. This study collected a triplet set of related courses and students' real historical grades, proved the correlation between courses through data analysis, and verified the effectiveness of different dimensional features. Experimental results show that, compared with traditional machine learning methods, our proposed method achieves better prediction accuracy with a precision rate of 72.5%. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Aim/Purpose This article proposes a framework based on a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design in the learning analytics domain to enhance the models used to support the success of the learning process and the learner. The framework consists of three main phases: (1) quantitative data analysis; (2) qualitative data analysis; and (3) integration and discussion of results. Furthermore, we illus-trated the application of this framework by examining the relationships between learning process metrics and academic performance in the subject of Computer Programming coupled with content analysis of the responses to a students’ per-ception questionnaire of their learning experiences in this subject. Background There is a prevalence of quantitative research designs in learning analytics, which limits the understanding of students’ learning processes. This is due to the abundance and ease of collection of quantitative data in virtual environ-ments and learning management systems compared to qualitative data. Methodology This study uses a mixed-methods, non-experimental, research design. The quan-titative phase of the framework aims to analyze the data to identify behaviors, trends, and relationships between measures using correlation or regression anal-ysis. On the other hand, the qualitative phase of the framework focuses on con-ducting a content analysis of the qualitative data. This framework was applied to historical quantitative and qualitative data from students’ use of an automated feedback and evaluation platform for programming exercises in a programming course at the National University of Colombia during 2019 and 2020. The re-search question of this study is: How can mixed-methods research applied to learning analytics generate a better understanding of the relationships between the variables generated throughout the learning process and the academic per-formance of students in the subject of Computer Programming? Contribution The main contribution of this work is the proposal of a mixed-methods learn-ing analytics framework applicable to computer programming courses, which al-lows for complementing, corroborating, or refuting quantitatively evidenced re-sults with qualitative data and generating hypotheses about possible causes or explanations for student behavior. In addition, the results provide a better un-derstanding of the learning processes in the Computer Programming course at the National University of Colombia. Findings A framework based on sequential explanatory mixed-methods design in the field of learning analytics has been proposed to improve the models used to support the success of the learning process and the learner. The answer to the research question posed corresponds to that the mixed methods effectively complement quantitative and qualitative data. From the analysis of the data of the application of the framework, it appears that the qualitative data, represent-ing the perceptions of the students, generally supported and extended the quan-titative data. The consistency between the two phases allowed us to generate hy-potheses about the possible causes of student behavior and provide a better un-derstanding of the learning processes in the course. Recommendations for Practitioners We suggest implementing the proposed mixed-methods learning analytics framework in various educational contexts and populations. By doing so, practi-tioners can gather more diverse data and insights, which can lead to a better un-derstanding of learning processes in different settings and with different groups of learners. Recommendations for Researchers Researchers can use the proposed approach in their learning analytics projects, usually based exclusively on quantitative data analysis, to complement their re-sults, find explanations for their students’ behaviors, and understand learning processes in depth thanks to the information provided by the complementary analysis of qualitative data. Impact on Society The prevalence of exclusively quantitative research designs in learning analytics can limit our understanding of students’ learning processes. Instead, the mixed-methods approach we propose suggests a more comprehensive approach to learning analytics that includes qualitative data, which can provide deeper in-sight into students’ learning experiences and processes. Ultimately, this can lead to more effective interventions and improvements in teaching and learning practices. Future Research Potential lines of research to continue the work on mixed-method learning ana-lytics methodology include the following: first, implementing the framework on a different population sample, such as students from other universities or other knowledge areas; second, using techniques to correct unbalanced data sets in learning analytics studies; third, analyzing student interactions with the auto-mated grading platform and their academic activities in relation with their activ-ity grades; last, using the findings to design interventions that positively impact academic performance and evaluating the impact statistically through experimental study designs. In the context of introductory programming educa-tion, AI/large language models have the potential to revolutionize teaching by enhancing the learning experience, providing personalized support, and ena-bling more efficient assessment and feedback mechanisms. Future research in this area is to implement the proposed framework on data from an introductory programming course using these models. © (2023), (Informing Science Institute). All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Information and communication technologies have been fulfilling a highly relevant role in the different fields of knowledge, addressing problems in various disciplines; there is an increased capacity to identify patterns and anomalies in an organization's data using data mining; In this context, the study aimed to develop a classification model for student dropout, applying machine learning with the autoML method of the H2O.ai framework; the dimensionality of the socioeconomic and academic characteristics has been taken into account, with the purpose that the directors make reasonable decisions to counteract the abandonment of the students in the study programs. The methodology used was of a technological type, purposeful level, incremental innovation, temporal scope, and synchronous; data collection was prospective. For this, a 20-item questionnaire was applied to 237 students enrolled in the master's degree programs in the education of the Graduate School. The research resulted in a supervised machine learning model, Gradient Reinforcement Machine (GBM), to classify student dropout, thus identifying the main associated factors that influence dropout, obtaining a Gini coefficient of 92.20%, AUC of 96.10% and a LogLoss of 24.24% representing a model with efficient performance.

abstract={Early warning of student performance is using data analytics to predict future trends in student performance as a way to intervene early in situations of academic risk. The popularity of machine learning has improved prediction accuracy. However, most current models only consider subjective student factors without examining the external environment and objective elements. Meanwhile, the global pandemic of COVID-19 has brought serious disruptions to teaching and learning in universities, and existing models cannot cope with this challenge. In this study, we propose a neural network model that integrates various internal and external factors and incorporates data-level sample synthesis and multi-classification cost-sensitive learning methods to achieve early warning of student performance in universities and improve teaching quality and management. Experimental results show that the model can be applied to teaching scenarios with a mixture of online and offline teaching, has higher accuracy than previous prediction mechanisms that only consider some student's academic characteristics, and outperforms traditional machine learning methods. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The project presented in this paper aims to formulate a recommendation framework that consolidates the higher education students’ particulars such as their academic background, current study and student activity records, their attended higher education institution’s expectations of graduate attributes and self-assessment of their own generic competencies. The gap between the higher education students’ generic competence development and their current statuses such as their academic performance and their student activity involvement was incorporated into the framework to come up with a recommendation for the student activities that lead to their generic competence development. For the formulation of the recommendation framework, the data mining tool Orange with some programming in Python and machine learning models was applied on 14,556 students’ activity and academic records in the case higher education institution to find out three major types of patterns between the students’ participation of the student activities and (1) their academic performance change, (2) their programmes of studies, and (3) their English results in the public examination.

abstract={Educational Data Mining (EDM) is an emergent discipline that concen-trates on the design of self-learning and adaptive approaches. Higher education institutions have started to utilize analytical tools to improve students’ grades and retention. Prediction of students’ performance is a difficult process owing to the massive quantity of educational data. Therefore, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques can be used for educational data mining in a big data environ-ment. At the same time, in EDM, the feature selection process becomes necessary in creation of feature subsets. Since the feature selection performance affects the predictive performance of any model, it is important to elaborately investigate the outcome of students’ performance model related to the feature selection techni-ques. With this motivation, this paper presents a new Metaheuristic Optimiza-tion-based Feature Subset Selection with an Optimal Deep Learning model (MOFSS-ODL) for predicting students’ performance. In addition, the proposed model uses an isolation forest-based outlier detection approach to eliminate the existence of outliers. Besides, the Chaotic Monarch Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (CBOA) is used for the selection of highly related features with low complexity and high performance. Then, a sailfish optimizer with stacked sparse autoencoder (SFO-SSAE) approach is utilized for the classification of educational data. The MOFSS-ODL model is tested against a benchmark student’s performance data set from the UCI repository. A wide-ranging simulation analysis por-trayed the improved predictive performance of the MOFSS-ODL technique over recent approaches in terms of different measures. Compared to other methods, experimental results prove that the proposed (MOFSS-ODL) classification model does a great job of predicting students’ academic progress, with an accuracy of 96.49%. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

abstract={Introduction: Emergency medicine (EM) is a required clerkship for third-year medical students, and an elective EM acting internship (AI) is available to fourth-year students at our institution. The Society for Academic Emergency Medicine's (SAEM) National Emergency Medicine M4 Examination (EM-M4) is administered to students at the end of the EM AI experience. To prepare for the exam, students gain access to 23 practice tests available from SAEM. In this study we investigate the correlation between the number of practice tests taken and EM-M4 performance. Methods: We collected data for EM-M4 and the US Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK) from students completing a MS4 EM clerkship in consecutive medical school classes from 2014-2017 at a private medical school. In addition, we collected data during the clerkship on the number of practice exams taken and whether a comprehensive practice exam was taken. We analyzed the study population three ways to determine whether the number of practice tests impacted final exam results: a binary distribution (1-11 or 12-23 tests taken); quaternary distribution (1-6, 7-12, 13-18, or 19-23 tests taken); and individual test variability (1,2,3,…22,23 tests taken). Complete data for 147 students was used for data analysis. Results: The EM-M4 showed moderate (r = 0.49) correlations with USMLE Step 2 CK. There was no significant difference in EM-M4 performance in the binary analysis (P ≤ 0.09), the quaternary analysis (P ≤ 0.09), or the continuous variable analysis (P ≤ 0.52). Inclusion of a comprehensive practice test also did not correlate with EM-M4 performance (P ≤ 0.78). Conclusion: Degree of utilization of SAEM practice tests did not seem to correlate with performance on the EM-M4 examination at our institution. This could be due to many factors including that the question bank is composed of items that had poor item discrimination, possible inadequate coverage of EM curriculum, and/or use of alternative study methods. While further investigation is needed, if our conclusions prove generalizable, then using the SAEM practice tests is an extraneous cognitive load from a modality without proven benefit.

abstract={With the rapid development of higher education, the evaluation of the academic growth potential of universities has received extensive attention from scholars and educational administrators. Although the number of papers on university academic evaluation is increasing, few scholars have conducted research on the changing trend of university academic performance. Because traditional statistical methods and deep learning techniques have proven to be incapable of handling short time series data well, this paper proposes to adopt topological data analysis (TDA) to extract specified features from short time series data and then construct the model for the prediction of trend of university academic performance. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by experiments on a real-world university academic performance dataset. By comparing the prediction results given by the Markov chain as well as SVM on the original data and TDA statistics, respectively, we demonstrate that the data generated by TDA methods can help construct very discriminative models and have a great advantage over the traditional models. In addition, this paper gives the prediction results as a reference, which provides a new perspective for the development evaluation of the academic performance of colleges and universities. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Educational data mining has become an effective tool for exploring the hidden relationships in educational data and predicting students' academic achievements. This study proposes a new model based on machine learning algorithms to predict the final exam grades of undergraduate students, taking their midterm exam grades as the source data. The performances of the random forests, nearest neighbour, support vector machines, logistic regression, Naïve Bayes, and k-nearest neighbour algorithms, which are among the machine learning algorithms, were calculated and compared to predict the final exam grades of the students. The dataset consisted of the academic achievement grades of 1854 students who took the Turkish Language-I course in a state University in Turkey during the fall semester of 2019–2020. The results show that the proposed model achieved a classification accuracy of 70–75%. The predictions were made using only three types of parameters; midterm exam grades, Department data and Faculty data. Such data-driven studies are very important in terms of establishing a learning analysis framework in higher education and contributing to the decision-making processes. Finally, this study presents a contribution to the early prediction of students at high risk of failure and determines the most effective machine learning methods. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Compliance with the basic conditions of quality in higher education implies the design of strategies to reduce student dropout, and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the educational field have allowed directing, reinforcing, and consolidating the process of professional academic training. We propose an academic and emotional tracking model that uses data mining and machine learning to group university students according to their level of dropout risk. We worked with 670 students from a Peruvian public university, applied 5 valid and reliable psychological assessment questionnaires to them using a chatbot-based system, and then classified them using 3 density-based unsupervised learning algorithms, DBSCAN, K-Means, and HDBSCAN. The results showed that HDBSCAN was the most robust option, obtaining better validity levels in two of the three internal indices evaluated, where the performance of the Silhouette index was 0.6823, the performance of the Davies–Bouldin index was 0.6563, and the performance of the Calinski–Harabasz index was 369.6459. The best number of clusters produced by the internal indices was five. For the validation of external indices, with answers from mental health professionals, we obtained a high level of precision in the F-measure: 90.9%, purity: 94.5%, V-measure: 86.9%, and ARI: 86.5%, and this indicates the robustness of the proposed model that allows us to categorize university students into five levels according to the risk of dropping out. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={The academic success of university students is a problem that depends in a multi-factorial way on the aspects related to the student and the career itself. A problem with this level of complexity needs to be faced with integral approaches, which involves the complement of numerical quantitative analysis with other types of analysis. This study uses a novel visual-predictive data analysis approach to obtain relevant information regarding the academic performance of students from a Peruvian university. This approach joins together domain understanding and data-visualization analysis, with the construction of machine learning models in order to provide a visual-predictive model of the students’ academic success. Specifically, a trained XGBoost Machine Learning model achieved a performance of up to 91.5% Accuracy. The results obtained alongside a visual data analysis allow us to identify the relevant variables associated with the students’ academic performances. In this study, this novel approach was found to be a valuable tool for developing and targeting policies to support students with lower academic performance or to stimulate advanced students. Moreover, we were able to give some insight into the academic situation of the different careers of the university. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Educational data mining (DEM) provides valuable educational information by applying data mining tools and techniques to analyze data at educational institutions. In this paper, tree-based machine learning algorithms are used to predict students’ overall academic performance in their bachelor’s program. The transcript data of the students in the same department in a Chinese university were collected. All the courses in the bachelor’s program were then divided into six typical categories, and the mean GPAs of each category were taken as primary input features for prediction. Three tree-based machine learning models were established, i.e. decision tree (DT), Gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and random forest (RF). Results show that we can successfully identify more than 80% of the students at low-performance risk using the RF model at the end of the second semester, which is meaningful because the global quality of teaching and learning of the department can be improved by taking targeted measures in time according to the machine learning model. Feature importance and the structure of decision tree were also analyzed to extract knowledge that is valuable for both students and teachers. The results of this case study can be used as a reference for other engineering departments in China. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The indicators of student success at higher education institutions are continuously analysed to increase the students’ enrolment in multiple scientific areas. Every semester, the students respond to a pedagogical survey that aims to collect the student opinion of curricular units in terms of content and teaching methodologies. Using this information, we intend to anticipate the success in higher-level courses and prevent dropouts. Specifically, this paper contributes with an interpretable student classification method. The proposed solution relies on (i) a pedagogical survey to collect student’s opinions; (ii) a statistical data analysis to validate the reliability of the survey; and (iii) machine learning algorithms to classify the success of a student. In addition, the proposed method includes an explainable mechanism to interpret the classifications and their main factors. This transparent pipeline was designed to have implications in both digital and sustainable education, impacting the three pillars of sustainability, i.e.,economic, social, and environmental, where transparency is a cornerstone. The work was assessed with a dataset from a Portuguese higher-level institution, contemplating multiple courses from different departments. The most promising results were achieved with Random Forest presenting 98% in accuracy and F-measure. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={The present work aims to construct knowledge systems of different specialties, provide personalized learning approaches for students, improve the teaching effectiveness of teachers and learning interests of students, and help students accurately diagnose their learning problems. First, the existing issues of students’ chemistry learning and knowledge systems are analyzed. Then, a personalized learning model is constructed based on the distributed computing method of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the clustering algorithm of deep learning (DL). This model realizes the effective classification of students by the DL algorithm according to the students’ learning data and designs diverse customized teaching contents in line with the performance of IoT. Finally, this model’s effectiveness is verified through the data analysis of 2019 chemistry students at M University. The research results indicate that 96.67% of students express satisfaction with the learning effect of the personalized learning model, and 100% of learners are satisfied with the various forms of teaching resources offered by this model. Besides, this model’s accuracy can reach 85% on the personalized learning platform based on IoT and DL algorithms. Compared with the latest research model, this model has a better performance in achievement prediction and customized recommendation. The test results of the actual effect demonstrate that the personalized learning system has achieved expected outcomes, significantly enhancing students’ understanding of knowledge with medium difficulty. In addition, learners are delighted with the model. They believe that the learning resources in the model can meet their learning needs, and they are willing to recommend the course to other learners actively. This model is of significant practical value to promote the development of IoT and DL technology in professional learning. This exploration innovatively stratifies learners’ level of understanding and provides personalized learning resources meeting the current cognitive competence of students to enhance learners’ knowledge and achieve personalized learning. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In Portugal, the dropout rate of university courses is around 29%. Understanding the reasons behind such a high desertion rate can drastically improve the success of students and universities. This work applies existing data mining techniques to predict the academic dropout mainly using the academic grades. Four different machine learning techniques are presented and analyzed. The dataset consists of 331 students who were previously enrolled in the Computer Engineering degree at the Universidade de Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro (UTAD). The study aims to detect students who may prematurely drop out using existing methods. The most relevant data features were identified using the Permutation Feature Importance technique. In the second phase, several methods to predict the dropouts were applied. Then, each machine learning technique’s results were displayed and compared to select the best approach to predict academic dropout. The methods used achieved good results, reaching an F1-Score of 81% in the final test set, concluding that students’ marks somehow incorporate their living conditions. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={This paper aims to improve the quality and efficiency of talent cultivation in colleges and universities and effectively analyze and count the number of talents. The cultivation of computer professionals in higher vocational education is taken as the research object. First, a talent cultivation information system for colleges and universities is developed, using deep learning neural networks and data mining algorithms and introducing recurrent neural networks (RNN) and a fusion attention model. With a view to the needs of employment forms and employment data, a diversified talent demand cultivation program is formulated. Based on this, an efficient talent cultivation quality indicator system is established through analyzing talent cultivation data in higher vocational education. Finally, the effectiveness of the system is verified by the performance analysis. The results show an average prediction accuracy for the proposed Attention RNN Word2 algorithm of 80.61%, which is significantly higher than achieved by the latest research algorithm model, and the talent training has a classification accuracy of 82%. This model is not only feasible for categorizing computer professional personnel cultivation but can also accurately reflect problems arising in personnel cultivation, and the results are made obvious by visualization. To sum up, the system reported here can give an intuitive demonstration of the quality of computer professional personnel cultivation in higher vocational education. This research provides a theoretical basis for related research into the cultivation of computer professionals in higher vocational education for application in industry, universities, and research. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={As education is an essential enabler in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it should “ensure inclusive, equitable quality education, and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”. One of the frameworks for SDG 4 is to propose the concepts of “equitable quality education”. To attain and work in the context of SDG 4, artificial intelligence (AI) is a booming technology, which is gaining interest in understanding student behavior and assessing student performance. AI holds great potential for improving education as it has started to develop innovative teaching and learning approaches in education to create better learning. To provide better education, data analytics is critical. AI and machine learning approaches provide rapid solutions with high accuracy. This paper presents an AI-based analytics tool created to predict student performance in a first-year Information Technology literacy course at The University of the South Pacific (USP). A Random Forest based classification model was developed which predicted the performance of the student in week 6 with an accuracy value of 97.03%, sensitivity value of 95.26%, specificity value of 98.8%, precision value of 98.86%, Matthews correlation coefficient value of 94% and Area Under the ROC Curve value of 99%. Hence, such a method is very useful in predicting student performance early in their courses of allowing for early intervention. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the experimental findings demonstrate that the suggested prediction model satisfies the required accuracy, precision, and recall factors for forecasting the behavioural elements of teaching and e-learning for students in virtual education systems. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Educational Data Mining (EDM) is used to extract and discover interesting patterns from educational institution datasets using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. There is much academic information related to students available. Therefore, it is helpful to apply data mining to extract factors affecting students’ academic performance. In this paper, a web-based system for predicting academic performance and identifying students at risk of failure through academic and demographic factors is developed. The ML model is developed to predict the total score of a course at the early stages. Several ML algorithms are applied, namely: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Linear Regression (LR). This model applies to the data of female students of the Computer Science Department at Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal University (IAU). The dataset contains 842 instances for 168 students. Moreover, the results showed that the prediction’s Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) reached 6.34%, and the academic factors had a higher impact on students’ academic performance than the demographic factors, the midterm exam score in the top. The developed web-based prediction system is available on an online server and can be used by tutors. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Aim/Purpose To gain insight into the opinions and reviews of Malaysian university students regarding e-learning systems, thereby improving the quality and services of these systems and resolving any problems, concerns, and issues that may exist within the institution. Background This exploratory study examines the students’ perceptions of e-learning in Ma-laysia based on Sentiment Analysis (SA) to gain a clear insight into their feelings about the quality of e-learning systems and related services in Malaysian univer-sities to determine whether these opinions are positive or negative. Methodology The data was collected from Twitter; the Full Archive Search API Premium v1.1 tire was chosen to access the tweets from November 1, 2019, to December 30, 2020. The R programming language library package “rtweet” was applied to ac-cess the search API and query the tweets. To classify students’ opinions, senti-ment analysis-based Machine Learning (ML) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) was utilized. Rapid Miner, a statistical and data mining tool, was used to determine the sentiment of tweets and the accuracy of the ML algorithm. After preparing the data, RapidMiner was used to pre-process and classify the final 1201 tweets based on sentiment, and National Research Council (NRC) word-emotion lexicon was used to detect the presence of eight emotions in the tweets. The confusion matrix is used to determine the classifier’s performance. Contribution This research provided evidence for the effective use of sentiment analysis as an indicator that may contribute to the development of educational systems, specifically, e-learning systems in Malaysian universities. Findings Based on the findings, the majority of students have a positive opinion about e-learning systems in Malaysian universities. Precisely, the results showed that 65% of sentiments were classified as positive and 35% as negative. Moreover, among the eight emotions, the majority of the tweets expressed a higher level of trust, anticipation, and joy. Recommendations for Practitioners The study findings could help classify the teachers’ strengths and weaknesses graphically based on the students’ positive and negative feedback. These find-ings would also help decision-makers and educationalists be more aware of stu-dents’ feelings (sentiments) and concerns. Thus, using social media sentiment analysis should be encouraged as a valuable source of information that may as-sist their educational decision-making, e-learning development, and perfor-mance evaluation. Recommendations for Researchers The findings may encourage other researchers to apply SA based ML approach and use Twitter as a data source to discover users’ opinions about certain issues in learning and teaching processes. Impact on Society Our study confirmed that social media data could provide valuable and support-ive information about educational systems and procedures in e-learning for ap-propriate decision-making regarding future development and strategies. Future Research Future work can experiment with other classification models and different ML classification algorithms as well as other feature extraction methods and com-pare the results to find the best accuracy that can improve the classification results © 2022, Journal of Information Technology Education: Research.All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Artificial intelligence technology brings wide impacts on several dimensions. The impact on the education system is that educational technology has been disrupted, it radically changed the paradigm of learning management. Therefore, this research aimed to study the paradigm shift of the education system focusing on the deployment of artificial intelligence technology to support the learning model in the era affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. There are two research objectives: (1) to study an appropriate self-regulated learning model with data mining techniques for designing appropriate online learning management, and (2) to study the learning achievement factors of learners by applying blended learning and self-regulated learning techniques. The samples were 26 students at the University of Phayao who enrolled in the course 221203 Technology for Business Application in the 2nd semester of the academic year 2020. The research tool is a statistical analysis and machine learning tool. It consists of analyzing pre-test scores, post-test scores, midterm scores, final scores, academic achievement, clustering analysis, and clustering performance. As a result, it found that learners had five reasonable clusters for the academic achievement learning model. The results specified the different learning styles of the learners in two dimensions including online and offline scenarios. Therefore, in future work, the researcher looks forward to performing research in the scope of identifying the suitability and the necessity of converting the face-to-face learning model to a fully online learning model. © 2022, International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning.

abstract={Nowadays, both predictive and descriptive modelling play a key role in decision-making processes in almost every branch of activity. In this article we are introducing IntelliDaM , a generic machine learning-based framework useful for improving the performance of data mining tasks and subsequently enhancing decision-making processes. Through its components designed for feature analysis, unsupervised and supervised learning-based data mining, IntelliDaM facilitates hidden knowledge discovery from data. Intensive research has been conducted in the field of educational data mining, as education institutions are interested in constantly adapting their educational programs to the needs of society by improving the quality of managerial decisions, course instructors' decision-making, or information gathering for course design. The present work conducts a longitudinal educational data mining study by applying IntelliDaM to real data collected at Babeş-Bolyai University, Romania, for a Computer Science course. The problem of mining educational data has been thoroughly examined using the proposed framework, with the goal of analysing students' performance. A very good performance has been achieved for the classification task (an F1 score of around 92%), and the results also highlighted a statistically significant performance improvement by using a technique for selecting discriminative data features. The performed study confirmed that IntelliDaM could be a useful instrument in educational environments, particularly for improving decision-making processes, like designing courses, the setup of efficient examinations, avoiding plagiarism, or offering support regarding stress management. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Among the current significant issues in talent cultivation is changing colleges' unique talent cultivation strategies and regulating the spontaneous connection of the talent cultivation, industrial, and entrepreneurial chains. In other terms, the growing disparity between college and university incorporation and industry demand for talent has made the growth of creative applied skills targeted to the industry want an acute problem. That is why colleges and universities must cultivate practical talent in a way that is effective, strong, low-cost, and creative. As a result, this research uses deep learning to develop an ensemble convolutional neural network with an attention mechanism to increase the performance and reliability of talent cultivation in universities and colleges and assess the talents properly. For this research, the datasets are gathered with the primary student and classroom information. Followed by standardising the data, the normalization technique is utilised. Then, the proposed method is employed for the data analysis. ANOVA, Chi-square test, and Student's t-test are applied for the statistical analysis. Finally, the performance of the proposed technique is examined and compared with existing methods to prove the students' highest performance in talent cultivation. © 2022 Jing Han.},

abstract={Data science is a new field of research that has attracted growing interest in recent years as it focuses on turning raw data into understanding, insight, knowledge, and value. New data science education programs, which are being launched at an increasing rate, are designed for multiple education levels and populations. Machine learning (ML) is an essential element of data science that requires an extensive background in mathematics. Whereas it is possible to teach the principles of ML only as a black box, novice learners might find it difficult to improve an algorithm’s performance without a white box understanding of the underlying ML algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a pedagogical method, based on hands-on pen-and-paper tasks, to support white box understanding of ML algorithms for learners who lack the level of mathematics knowledge required for this purpose. Data were collected using a comprehension questionnaire and analyzed according to the process-object theory borrowed from mathematics education research. We present evidence of the effectiveness of this method based on data collected in an introduction-level data science course for graduate psychology students. This population had extensive psychology domain knowledge, as well as an established background in statistics, but had gaps in mathematical and computer science knowledge compared with data science majors. The research contribution is both practical and theoretical. Practically, we present a learning module that supports non-major data science students’ white box understanding of ML. Theoretically, we propose a data analysis method to evaluate students’ conceptions of ML algorithms. © 2022},

abstract={In this paper, through data analysis of multimodal knowledge graph optimized neural network and visual analysis of college students' sports performance, we use huge graph, a graph database supporting distributed storage, to store domain knowledge in the form of the knowledge graph, use Spring Boot to build a server-side framework, use Vue framework combined with vis.js to visualize relational network graphs, and design and implement a knowledge-oriented. This paper proposes a visual analytics system based on the theory of visual analytics. Based on the idea of visual analytics, this paper presents a visual analytics framework combining predictive models. This framework combines the automated analysis capability of predictive models with interactive visualization as a new idea to explore the visual analysis of student behavior and performance changes. Using relevant predictive algorithms in machine learning, corresponding models are built to refine the importance of features for visual analysis and correlate behavioral data with achievement data. In this process, multiple prediction algorithms are used to build prediction models. The model effects are analyzed and compared to select the optimal model for use in the visual analytics framework. The graphical analytic view is integrated. EduRedar, an optical analytical system for sports data based on the performance prediction model, is designed and implemented to support multidimensional and multiangle data analysis and visualize the changes in college students' sports and performance based on accurate campus exercise data. © 2022 Nan Zheng et al.},

abstract={Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased the importance of Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) instigating students to study from their homes. Every day a tremendous amount of data is generated when students interact with VLEs to perform different activities and access learning material. To make the generated data useful, it must be processed and managed by the proper machine learning (ML) algorithm. ML algorithms’ applications are many folds with Education Data Mining (EDM) and Learning Analytics (LA) as their major fields. ML algorithms are commonly used to process raw data to discover hidden patterns and construct a model to make future predictions, such as predicting students’ performance, dropouts, engagement, etc. However, in VLE, it is important to select the right and most applicable ML algorithm to give the best performance results. In this study, we aim to improve those ML and DL algorithms’ performance that give an inferior performance in terms of performance, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Several ML algorithms were applied on Open University Learning Analytics (OULA) dataset to reveal which one offers the best results in terms of performance, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Two popular ML algorithms called Decision Tree (DT) and Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) provided unsatisfactory results. They were selected and experimented with various techniques such as grid search cross-validation, adaptive boosting, extreme gradient boosting, early stopping, feature engineering, and dropping inactive neurons to improve their performance scores. Moreover, we also determined the feature weights/importance in predicting the students’ study performance, leading to the design and development of the adaptive learning system. The ML techniques and the methods used in this research study can be used by instructors/administrators to optimize learning content and provide informed guidance to students, thus improving their learning experience and making it exciting and adaptive © 2022 Adnan et al},

abstract={Selecting a proper study path in higher education is a difficult task for many students. They either have a lack of knowledge on the study pathoffered or are unsure of their interest in the various options. The current educationalsetups enable us to collect valid and reliable data on student success andlearning behaviour. This study explores and solves the problem of what path toselect by proposing possible study paths with the help of machine learning algorithms.Learning analytics (LA) and educational data mining (EDM) are technologiesthat aid in the analysis of educational data. In this quantitative study,we applied a questionnaire to collect data from students at the Business InformationTechnology Department (Bite) at the Haaga-Helia University of AppliedScience. We managed to collect 101 samples from students during 2017–2018.We used various machine learning algorithms and prediction models to assessthe best approach for study path selection. We applied three performance scoresof accuracy, Cohen’s Kappa, and ROC curve to measure the accuracy of thealgorithm results. KNIME analytics was selected as a proper tool to pre-process,prepare, analyse, and model the data. The results indicate that Random Forest(94% accuracy) and Decision Tree (93% accuracy) are the best classificationmodels for students’ study path selection. The contribution of this study is foreducational data mining research to assess the comparison of various algorithms.Furthermore, this is a novel approach to predict students’ study path selection,which educational institutes should develop to assist students in their studypath selection © 2022, International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies.

abstract={Background: Poor academic performance and failure can cause undesired effects for students, schools, and society. Understanding why some students fail while their peers succeed is important to enhance student performance. Therefore, this study explores the differences in the learning process between high- and low-achieving pre-clinical medical students from a theory of action perspective. Methods: This study employed a qualitative instrumental case study design intended to compare two groups of students—high-achieving students (n = 14) and low-achieving students (n = 5), enrolled in pre-clinical medical studies at the Universiti Malaya, Malaysia. Data were collected through reflective journals and semi-structured interviews. Regarding journaling, participants were required to recall their learning experiences of the previous academic year. Two analysts coded the data and then compared the codes of high- and low-achieving students. The third analyst reviewed the codes. Themes were identified iteratively, working towards comparing the learning processes of high- and low-achieving students. Results: Data analysis revealed four themes—motivation and expectation, study methods, self-management, and flexibility of mindset. First, high-achieving students were more motivated and had higher academic expectations than low-achieving students. Second, high-achieving students adopted study planning and deep learning approaches, whereas low-achieving students adopted superficial learning approaches. Third, in contrast to low-achieving students, high-achieving students exhibited better time management and studied consistently. Finally, high-achieving students proactively sought external support and made changes to overcome challenges. In contrast, low-achieving students were less resilient and tended to avoid challenges. Conclusion: Based on the theory of action, high-achieving students utilize positive governing variables, whereas low-achieving students are driven by negative governing variables. Hence, governing variable-based remediation is needed to help low-achieving students interrogate the motives behind their actions and realign positive governing variables, actions, and intended outcomes.Key Messages This study found four themes describing the differences between high- and low-achieving pre-clinical medical students: motivation and expectation, study methods, self-management, and flexibility of mindset. Based on the theory of action approach, high-achieving pre-clinical medical students are fundamentally different from their low-achieving peers in terms of their governing variables, with the positive governing variables likely to have guided them to act in a manner beneficial to and facilitating desirable academic performance. Governing variable-based remediation may help students interrogate the motives of their actions. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Attrition is one of the main concerns in distance learning due to the impact on the incomes and institutions reputation. Timely identification of students at risk has high practical value in effective students’ retention services. Big Data mining and machine learning methods are applied to manipulate, analyze, and predict students’ failure, supporting self-directed learning. Despite the extensive application of data mining to education, the imbalance problem in minority classes of students’ attrition is often overlooked in conventional models. This document proposes a large data frame using the Hadoop ecosystem and the application of machine learning techniques to different datasets of an academic year at the Hellenic Open University. Datasets were divided into 35 weeks; 32 classifiers were created, compared and statistically analyzed to address the minority classes’ imbalance of student’s failure. The algorithms MetaCost-SMO and C4.5 provide the most accurate performance for each target class. Early predictions of timeframes determine a remarkable performance, while the importance of written assignments and specific quizzes is noticeable. The models’ performance in any week is exploited by developing a prediction tool for student attrition, contributing to timely and personalized intervention. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Predicting students at risk of academic failure is valuable for higher education institutions to improve student performance. During the pandemic, with the transition to compulsory distance learning in higher education, it has become even more important to identify these students and make instructional interventions to avoid leaving them behind. This goal can be achieved by new data mining techniques and machine learning methods. This study took both the synchronous and asynchronous activity characteristics of students into account to identify students at risk of academic failure during the pandemic. Additionally, this study proposes an optimal ensemble model predicting students at risk using a combination of relevant machine learning algorithms. Performances of over two thousand university students were predicted with an ensemble model in terms of gender, degree, number of downloaded lecture notes and course materials, total time spent in online sessions, number of attendances, and quiz score. Asynchronous learning activities were found more determinant than synchronous ones. The proposed ensemble model made a good prediction with a specificity of 90.34%. Thus, practitioners are suggested to monitor and organize training activities accordingly. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={University education has become an integral and basic part of most people preparing for working life. However, placement of students into the appropriate university, college, or discipline is of paramount importance for university education to perform its role. In this study, various explainable machine learning approaches (Decision Tree [DT], Extra tree classifiers [ETC], Random forest [RF] classifiers, Gradient boosting classifiers [GBC], and Support Vector Machine [SVM]) were tested to predict students’ right undergraduate major (field of specialization) before admission at the undergraduate level based on the current job markets and experience. The DT classifier predicts the target class based on simple decision rules. ETC is an ensemble learning technique that builds prediction models by using unpruned decision trees. RF is also an ensemble technique that uses many individual DTs to solve complex problems. GBC classifiers and produce strong prediction models. SVM predicts the target class with a high margin, as compared to other classifiers. The imbalanced dataset includes secondary school marks, higher secondary school marks, experience, and salary to select specialization for students in undergraduate programs. The results showed that the performances of RF and GBC predict the student field of specialization (undergraduate major) before admission, as well as the fact that these measures are as good as DT and ETC. Statistical analysis (Spearman correlation) is also applied to evaluate the relationship between a student’s major and other input variables. The statistical results show that higher student marks in higher secondary (hsc_p), university degree (Degree_p), and entry test (etest_p) play an important role in the student’s area of specialization, and we can recommend study fields according to these features. Based on these results, RF and GBC can easily be integrated into intelligent recommender systems to suggest a good field of specialization to university students, according to the current job market. This study also demonstrates that marks in higher secondary and university and entry tests are useful criteria to suggest the right undergraduate major because these input features most accurately predict the student field of specialization. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Information is everywhere in a hidden and scattered way. It becomes useful when we apply Data mining to extracts the hidden, meaningful, and potentially useful patterns from these vast data resources. Educational data mining ensures a quality education by analyzing educational data based on various aspects. In this paper, we have analyzed the academic results and behavior of some engineering students. For this study, we collect data from 80 students from the CSE department. We gather data from mark sheets and other relevant factors that accelerate the results, collected through a survey. Our main goal is to predict the students’ performance. According to this prediction, the counseling department will guide them in advance so that those who are likely to have bad results can do better. The classification can be based on various aspects, as many factors improve the educational system. We have created two datasets focusing on two different angles. Our first dataset classifies and predicts the category of a student (good, bad, medium) on a specific course based on their prerequisite course performance. We have implemented this in the artificial intelligence course. Our second dataset also classifies and predicts the final grade (A, B, C) of any random subject, here we organize our data such a way where it will only focus on how their performance was till the midterm exam. We analyze and compare six classification algorithms. We have focused on all aspects of an algorithm, not only the accuracy level but also the complexity and cost. We have built two final models for two of our datasets based on a decision tree and the naive Bayes algorithms accordingly. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Under the premise of active in the field of machine learning, this paper takes online teaching system of ideological and Political education as an example to study machine learning and machine teaching system. In order to specifically understand the current situation of the construction and application of machine teaching based on supervised teaching of ideological and political theory courses in local colleges and universities, this experiment first conducted a statistical analysis of the learning results of the surveyed classes in two semesters from March 2020 to December 2020. The experimental data show that there is a positive interaction between teachers and students. Most students use the interactive communication mode of machines, while a small number of students use real-time interactive discussions with teachers. The experimental results show that the excellent rate of ABC classes in the first semester is 80%, 82% and 90%, respectively, through the machine-supervised teaching mode. Therefore, supervised machine learning can greatly help students improve their academic performance. In the future, we should further explore the application of other personalized and extensible machine learning methods in quality education. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.},

abstract={Currently, universities are going through a critical moment due to the coronavirus disease in 2019. To prevent its spread, countries have declared quarantines and isolation in all sectors of society. This has caused many problems in the learning of students, since, when moving from a face-to-face educational model to a remote model, several academic factors such as psychological, financial, and methodological have been overlooked. To exactly identify the variables and causes that affect learning, in this work a data analysis model using a Hadoop framework is proposed. By processing the data, it is possible to identify and classify students to determine the problems they present in different learning activities. The results are used by an artificial intelligence system that takes student information and converts it into knowledge, evaluates the academic performance problems they present, and determines what type of activity aligns with the students. The artificial intelligence system processes the information and recommends activities that focus on each student’s abilities and needs. The integration of these systems to universities creates an adaptive educational model that responds to the new challenges of society. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Mathematics is the engine, vehicle, driver, and language of today’s initiatives, innovations, and human endeavors. In this mathematical-driven world, the ability to perform mathematical tasks and logical reasoning is also essential in solving quotidian tasks and problems. Therefore, mathematical competency and problem-solving skills are kept as an integral component in almost every educational curriculum around the globe. However, there are numerous stumbling blocks along the way to successful teaching, conducive learning environment, and good student performances in almost all disciplines, but more prevalent and visible in mathematics. The major concerns of educators responsible for teaching mathematics and mathematics-related courses are to find effective and innovative ways to deliver mathematical content, to extend the concepts and theories beyond the classrooms, to integrate mathematics with important concepts such as gamification, data mining, learning analytics, deep learning, and effective tools such as mobile devices, learning management systems, and digital technology, and to maintain a good record of students’ performance. In online deliveries, these concerns are further escalated due to no or limited one-to-one interactions and lack of face time, to mention a few. This article investigates the efficacy and effectiveness of traditional and innovative pedagogical practices used in online mathematic courses at the University of the South Pacific (USP). It examines the interdependence of embedded activities and students’ achievement. The results indicate that these online mathematics courses were highly dominated by conventional approaches and were less interactive and engaging, resulting in lower success rates when compared to the courses from other disciplines. To recommend possible ways to enhance the quality of learning and teaching in online mathematics courses, selected online courses from the information system discipline were explored. The reasons for the high online presence in the course were investigated and activities that could lead to collaborative and active learning beyond the passive materials were data mined. The evidence drawn from the statistical analysis highlights the importance of including selected interactive and engaging activities in online learning space of mathematics courses to promote student engagement and help create a sense of community among geographically dispersed students. Overall, based on the observations and theoretical foundation from literature, it can be said that including regular and frequent active assessment strategies, such as weekly quizzes and discussion forums, could extend and promote interactive and engaging learning in online learning space. © Copyright © 2021 Raza and Reddy.},

abstract={The Learning Analytics community has recently paid particular attention to early predict learners’ performance. An established approach entails training classification models from past learner-related data in order to predict the exam success rate of a student well before the end of the course. Early predictions allow teachers to put in place targeted actions, e.g., supporting at-risk students to avoid exam failures or course dropouts. Although several machine learning and data mining solutions have been proposed to learn accurate predictors from past data, the interpretability and explainability of the best performing models is often limited. Therefore, in most cases, the reasons behind classifiers’ decisions remain unclear. This paper proposes an Explainable Learning Analytics solution to analyze learner-generated data acquired by our technical university, which relies on a blended learning model. It adopts classification techniques to early predict the success rate of about 5000 students who were enrolled in the first year courses of our university. It proposes to apply associative classifiers at different time points and to explore the characteristics of the models that led to assign pass or fail success rates. Thanks to their inherent interpretability, associative models can be manually explored by domain experts with the twofold aim at validating classifier outcomes through local rule-based explanations and identifying at-risk/successful student profiles by interpreting the global rule-based model. The results of an in-depth empirical evaluation demonstrate that associative models (i) perform as good as the best performing classification models, and (ii) give relevant insights into the per-student success rate assignments. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Predicting students' academic performance at an early stage of a semester is one of the most crucial research topics in the field of Educational Data Mining (EDM). Students are facing various difficulties in courses like 'Programming' and 'Data Structures' through undergraduate programs, which is why failure and dropout rates in these courses are high. Therefore, EDM is used to analyze students' data gathered from various educational settings to predict students' academic performance, which would help them to achieve better results in their future courses. The main goal of this paper is to explore the efficiency of deep learning in the field of EDM, especially in predicting students' academic performance, to identify students at risk of failure. A dataset collected from a public 4-year university was used in this study to develop predictive models to predict students' academic performance of upcoming courses given their grades in the previous courses of the first academic year using a deep neural network (DNN), decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, logistic regression, support vector classifier, and K-nearest neighbor. In addition, we made a comparison between various resampling methods to solve the imbalanced dataset problem, such as SMOTE, ADASYN, ROS, and SMOTE-ENN. From the experimental results, it is observed that the proposed DNN model can predict students' performance in a data structure course and can also identify students at risk of failure at an early stage of a semester with an accuracy of 89%, which is higher than models like decision tree, logistic regression, support vector classifier, and K-nearest neighbor. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={There is an increasing awareness that predictive analytics helps universities to evaluate students' performances. Big data analytics, such as student demographic datasets, can provide insight that helps to support academic success and completion rates. For example, learning analytics is an essential component of big data in universities that can provide strategic decision makers with the opportunity to perform a time series analysis of learning activities. A two-year retrospective analysis of student learning data from the University of Ha'il was conducted for this study. Predictive deep learning techniques, the bidirectional long short term model (BLSTM), were utilized to investigate students whose retention was at risk. The model has diverse features which can be utilized to assess how new students will perform and thus contributes to early prediction of student retention and dropout. Further, the condition random field (CRF) method for sequence labeling was used to predict each student label independently. Experimental results obtained with the predictive model indicates that prediction of student retention is possible with a high level of accuracy using BLSTM and CRF deep learning techniques. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Quality assurance is one major concern for the faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (FCSIT) at Jerash University. It involves eight standards including the strategic planning. SWOT analysis is a method meant for assisting the formulation of strategy and planning. An application to strategic planning process formulation for the FCSIT is described. This research studies the SWOT analysis with a major concern of drawing more conclusions using machine learning methods. Data mining is a subfield of machine learning, which focuses on exploratory data analysis using supervised or unsupervised learning. Data mining techniques help fetching required knowledge from raw data to make decisions more confidently interpreted and automated. In this study, regression, classification, clustering, association rules, attributes selection techniques are used to mine data from the SWOT analysis. Using Weka workbench, results of each technique is obtained and interpreted with the favor of the factors that have impact on the success of the strategic plan. The outcome presents a high level of satisfaction regarding employee, and a vibrant level of satisfaction regarding students. Therefore, the developed quality assurance framework is stable but needs more improvements to overcome the dissatisfaction of many students regarding services, supervision, awards and activities. © Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan (ZUJ).},

abstract={Data mining is employed to extract useful information and to detect patterns from often large data sets, closely related to knowledge discovery in databases and data science. In this investigation, we formulate models based on machine learning algorithms to extract relevant information predicting student retention at various levels, using higher education data and specifying the relevant variables involved in the modeling. Then, we utilize this information to help the process of knowledge discovery. We predict student retention at each of three levels during their first, second, and third years of study, obtaining models with an accuracy that exceeds 80% in all scenarios. These models allow us to adequately predict the level when dropout occurs. Among the machine learning algorithms used in this work are: decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, naive Bayes, random forest, and support vector machines, of which the random forest technique performs the best. We detect that secondary educational score and the community poverty index are important predictive variables, which have not been previously reported in educational studies of this type. The dropout assessment at various levels reported here is valid for higher education institutions around the world with similar conditions to the Chilean case, where dropout rates affect the efficiency of such institutions. Having the ability to predict dropout based on student’s data enables these institutions to take preventative measures, avoiding the dropouts. In the case study, balancing the majority and minority classes improves the performance of the algorithms. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The process of international integration is accelerating continuously, which puts forward certain requirements for the current college students' communicative ability and English ability. Therefore, it is necessary to further improve the students' cross-cultural communicative ability in combination with English teaching. This paper combines machine learning and fuzzy mathematics methods to build an evaluation model of English cross-cultural communication ability. Moreover, based on the basic assumptions of college students' oral communication ability evaluation, this paper builds a basic model for college students' oral communication ability evaluation. In addition, through factor analysis and correlation analysis, this paper verifies the hypothesis of the student's oral communication ability evaluation model and obtains an optimized university student's oral communication ability evaluation model. After the model's hypothesis testing and a series of statistical analysis, the evaluation system of college students' oral communication ability is finally obtained. Finally, this article combines the investigation and analysis to test the performance of the model constructed in this article. The research results show that the capability evaluation model constructed in this paper has good performance. © 2021 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Multi-view learning is a machine learning app0roach aiming to exploit the knowledge retrieved from data, represented by multiple feature subsets known as views. Co-training is considered the most representative form of multi-view learning, a very effective semi-supervised classification algorithm for building highly accurate and robust predictive models. Even though it has been implemented in various scientific fields, it has not adequately used in educational data mining and learning analytics, since the hypothesis about the existence of two feature views cannot be easily implemented. Some notable studies have emerged recently dealing with semi-supervised classification tasks, such as student performance or student dropout prediction, while semi-supervised regression is uncharted territory. Therefore, the present study attempts to implement a semi-regression algorithm for predicting the grades of undergraduate students in the final exams of a one-year online course, which exploits three independent and naturally formed feature views, since they are derived from different sources. Moreover, we examine a well-established framework for interpreting the acquired results regarding their contribution to the final outcome per student/instance. To this purpose, a plethora of experiments is conducted based on data offered by the Hellenic Open University and representative machine learning algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the early prognosis of students at risk of failure can be accurately achieved compared to supervised models, even for a small amount of initially collected data from the first two semesters. The robustness of the applying semi-supervised regression scheme along with supervised learners and the investigation of features’ reasoning could highly benefit the educational domain. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Predicting students’ academic performance has been a research area of interest in recent years, with many institutions focusing on improving the students’ performance and the education quality. The analysis and prediction of students’ performance can be achieved using various data mining techniques. Moreover, such techniques allow instructors to determine possible factors that may affect the students’ final marks. To that end, this work analyzes two different undergraduate datasets at two different universities. Furthermore, this work aims to predict the students’ performance at two stages of course delivery (20% and 50% respectively). This analysis allows for properly choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithms to use as well as optimize the algorithms’ parameters. Furthermore, this work adopts a systematic multi-split approach based on Gini index and p-value. This is done by optimizing a suitable bagging ensemble learner that is built from any combination of six potential base machine learning algorithms. It is shown through experimental results that the posited bagging ensemble models achieve high accuracy for the target group for both datasets. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Transferring knowledge from one domain to another has gained a lot of attention among scientists in recent years. Transfer learning is a machine learning approach aiming to exploit the knowledge retrieved from one problem for improving the predictive performance of a learning model for a different but related problem. This is particularly the case when there is a lack of data regarding a problem, but there is plenty of data about another related one. To this end, the present study intends to investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning from deep neural networks for the task of students' performance prediction in higher education. Since building predictive models in the Educational Data Mining field through transfer learning methods has been poorly studied so far, we consider this study as an important step in this direction. Therefore, a plethora of experiments were conducted based on data originating from five compulsory courses of two undergraduate programs. The experimental results demonstrate that the prognosis of students at risk of failure can be achieved with satisfactory accuracy in most cases, provided that datasets of students who have attended other related courses are available. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={The measurement of student performance during their progress through university study provides academic leadership with critical information on each student’s likelihood of success. Academics have traditionally used their interactions with individual students through class activities and interim assessments to identify those “at risk” of failure/withdrawal. However, modern university environments, offering easy on-line availability of course material, may see reduced lecture/tutorial attendance, making such identification more challenging. Modern data mining and machine learning techniques provide increasingly accurate predictions of student examination assessment marks, although these approaches have focussed upon large student populations and wide ranges of data attributes per student. However, many university modules comprise relatively small student cohorts, with institutional protocols limiting the student attributes available for analysis. It appears that very little research attention has been devoted to this area of analysis and prediction. We describe an experiment conducted on a final-year university module student cohort of 23, where individual student data are limited to lecture/tutorial attendance, virtual learning environment accesses and intermediate assessments. We found potential for predicting individual student interim and final assessment marks in small student cohorts with very limited attributes and that these predictions could be useful to support module leaders in identifying students potentially “at risk.”. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={From traditional face-to-face courses, asynchronous distance learning, synchronous live learning, to even blended learning approaches, the learning approach can be more learner-centralized, enabling students to learn anytime and anywhere. In this study, we applied educational data mining to explore the learning behaviors in data generated by students in a blended learning course. The experimental data were collected from two classes of Python programming related courses for first-year students in a university in northern Taiwan. During the semester, high-risk learners could be predicted accurately by data generated from the blended educational environment. The f1-score of the random forest model was 0.83, which was higher than the f1-score of logistic regression and decision tree. The model built in this study could be extrapolated to other courses to predict students' learning performance, where the F1-score was 0.77. Furthermore, we used machine learning and symmetry-based learning algorithms to explore learning behaviors. By using the hierarchical clustering heat map, this study could define the students' learning patterns including the positive interactive group, stable learning group, positive teaching material group, and negative learning group. These groups also corresponded with the student conscious questionnaire. With the results of this research, teachers can use the mid-term forecasting system to find high-risk groups during the semester and remedy their learning behaviors in the future. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={With the unprecedented development of the Internet, it also brings the challenge of Internet Addiction (IA), which is hard to diagnose and cure according to the state-of-art research. In this study, we explored the feasibility of machine learning methods to detect IA. We acquired a dataset consisting of 2397 Chinese college students from the University (Age: 19.17 ± 0.70, Male: 64.17%) who completed Brief Self Control Scale (BSCS), the 11th version of Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), Chinese Big Five Personality Inventory (CBF-PI) and Chen Internet Addiction Scale (CIAS), where CBF-PI includes five sub-features (Openness, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) and BSCS includes three sub-features (Attention, Motor and Non-planning). We applied Student's t-test on the dataset for feature selection and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) including C-SVM and ν-SVM with grid search for the classification and parameters optimization. This work illustrates that SVM is a reliable method for the assessment of IA and questionnaire data analysis. The best detection performance of IA is 96.32% which was obtained by C-SVM in the 6-feature dataset without normalization. Finally, the BIS-11, BSCS, Motor, Neuroticism, Non-planning, and Conscientiousness are shown to be promising features for the detection of IA. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Digital data are transforming higher education (HE) to be more student-focused and metrics-centred. In the UK, capturing detailed data about students has become a government priority, with an emphasis on using student data to measure, compare and assess university performance. The purpose of this paper is to examine the governmental and commercial drivers of current large-scale technological efforts to collect and analyse student data in UK HE. The result is an expanding data infrastructure which includes large-scale and longitudinal datasets, learning analytics services, student apps, data dashboards and digital learning platforms powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Education data scientists have built positive pedagogic cases for student data analysis, learning analytics and AI. The politicization and commercialization of the wider HE data infrastructure is translating them into performance metrics in an increasingly market-driven sector, raising the need for policy frameworks for ethical, pedagogically valuable uses of student data in HE. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Learning analytics, education data science and artificial intelligence are opening up new ways of collecting and analysing student data in higher education. UK government policies emphasize the use of student data for improvements to teaching and learning. What this paper adds A conceptual framework from “infrastructure studies” demonstrates how political objectives and commercial aims are fused to HE data systems, with data infrastructure becoming a key tool of government reform. A critical infrastructure analysis shows that student data processing technologies are being developed and deployed to measure university performance through student data. Implications for practice and/or policy Educators and managers in universities need to prepare robust institutional frameworks to govern their use of student data. Learning analytics practitioners, data scientists, learning scientists and social science researchers need to collaborate with the policy community and education technology developers on new policy frameworks to challenge narrow uses of student data as performance metrics. © 2019 British Educational Research Association},

abstract={The use of machine learning and data mining techniques across many disciplines has exploded in recent years with the field of educational data mining growing significantly in the past 15 years. In this study, random forest and logistic regression models were used to construct early warning models of student success in introductory calculus-based mechanics (Physics 1) and electricity and magnetism (Physics 2) courses at a large eastern land-grant university. By combining in-class variables such as homework grades with institutional variables such as cumulative GPA, we can predict if a student will receive less than a "B" in the course with 73% accuracy in Physics 1 and 81% accuracy in Physics 2 with only data available in the first week of class using logistic regression models. The institutional variables were critical for high accuracy in the first four weeks of the semester. In-class variables became more important only after the first in-semester examination was administered. The student's cumulative college GPA was consistently the most important institutional variable. Homework grade became the most important in-class variable after the first week and consistently increased in importance as the semester progressed; homework grade became more important than cumulative GPA after the first in-semester examination. Demographic variables including gender, race or ethnicity, and first generation status were not important variables for predicting course grade. © 2019 authors.

abstract={Applying data mining methods in the educational field has gained a lot of attention among researchers in recent years. Educational Data Mining has turned into an effective tool for uncovering hidden relationships in educational data and predicting students' learning outcomes. Several supervised methods have been successfully applied with the purpose of identifying students at risk of failing or of predicting their academic performance. Recently, the implementation of Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods in the educational process indicated their superiority over the supervised ones. SSL is an emerging subfield of machine learning seeking to effectively exploit a small pool of labeled examples together with a large pool of unlabeled ones. On this basis, a small number of students' data from previous years may be used as the training set of a learning model to predict future outcomes of current students. A number of rewarding studies deal with the implementation of classification methods in the educational field in contrast to regression, which is deemed to be a slightly touched task. In this paper, a novel semi-supervised regression (SSR) algorithm is presented for predicting the final grade of undergraduate students in a distance online course. To the best of our knowledge there is no study dealing with the implementation of SSR methods in the educational field. A plethora of attributes related to students' characteristics, academic performance and interaction within the course online platform form the training set, while several experiments were carried out confirming the superiority of the proposed algorithm over familiar regression methods. The experiment results show that the predictive performance of the proposed algorithm is increasing significantly over time, achieving a MAE value of less than 1.2358 before the middle of the academic year, which provides the advantage of early warnings and interventions. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Physics education research (PER) has used quantitative modeling techniques to explore learning, affect, and other aspects of physics education. However, these studies have rarely examined the predictive output of the models, instead focusing on the inferences or causal relationships observed in various data sets. This research introduces a modern predictive modeling approach to the PER community using transcript data for students declaring physics majors at Michigan State University. Using a machine learning model, this analysis demonstrates that students who switch from a physics degree program to an engineering degree program do not take the third semester course in thermodynamics and modern physics, and may take engineering courses while registered as a physics major. Performance in introductory physics and calculus courses, measured by grade as well as a students' declared gender and ethnicity play a much smaller role relative to the other features included in the model. These results are used to compare traditional statistical analysis to a more modern modeling approach. © 2019 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.},

abstract={The present work proposes the application of machine learning techniques to predict the final grades (FGs) of students based on their historical performance of grades. The proposal was applied to the historical academic information available for students enrolled in the computer engineering degree at an Ecuadorian university. One of the aims of the university's strategic plan is the development of a quality education that is intimately linked with sustainable development goals (SDGs). The application of technology in teaching-learning processes (Technology-enhanced learning) must become a key element to achieve the objective of academic quality and, as a consequence, enhance or benefit the common good. Today, both virtual and face-to-face educational models promote the application of information and communication technologies (ICT) in both teaching-learning processes and academic management processes. This implementation has generated an overload of data that needs to be processed properly in order to transform it into valuable information useful for all those involved in the field of education. Predicting a student's performance from their historical grades is one of the most popular applications of educational data mining and, therefore, it has become a valuable source of information that has been used for different purposes. Nevertheless, several studies related to the prediction of academic grades have been developed exclusively for the benefit of teachers and educational administrators. Little or nothing has been done to show the results of the prediction of the grades to the students. Consequently, there is very little research related to solutions that help students make decisions based on their own historical grades. This paper proposes a methodology in which the process of data collection and pre-processing is initially carried out, and then in a second stage, the grouping of students with similar patterns of academic performance was carried out. In the next phase, based on the identified patterns, the most appropriate supervised learning algorithm was selected, and then the experimental process was carried out. Finally, the results were presented and analyzed. The results showed the effectiveness of machine learning techniques to predict the performance of students. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={This paper aims to study the problem of the dropout situation of students in the business computer program at the University of Phayao. It consists of three sub-goals: (1) The first objective is to identify factors related to the dropout of students in the business computer program at the University of Phayao. (2) The second objective is to study the relationship between factors related to drop-out of students in the business computer program at the University of Phayao. (3) The last objective is to test the relationship model of factors related to the dropout of students in the business computer program at the University of Phayao. The sample group was 389 students from Business Computer Department at the School of Information and Communication Technology, University of Phayao in the academic year 2012-2019. The tools used in the research are statistical data analysis and machine learning. It consists of percentages, decision tree algorithms, cross-validation methods, and the confusion matrix performance. The results showed that the dropout rate of learners in business computer program tended to increase even though the number of new students decreased. In addition, it was found that factors affecting the dropout consisted of six courses: 221110 Fundamental Information Technology, 221120 Introduction to Programming, 001103 Thai Language Skills, 128221 Principles of Marketing, 005171 Life and Health, and 122130 Principles of Management. © 2019, iJET.},
